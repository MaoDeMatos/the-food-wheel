# üç± The Food Wheel

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project created to experiment with **_Next.js 13_** (the `AppDir` and later on, [`Turbopack`](https://turbo.build/pack)).

## If you don't know where to eat, let the wheel decide for you !

You only need to enter the different options you consider, and the wheel will do the rest for you !

üçΩÔ∏è Enjoy your meal !

The idea comes from [La roue de la bouffe](http://www.larouedelabouffe.fr/), which does the exact same thing !
